                            On 22 November 2024, CAC conducted a one-hour virtual online session on winter wellness attended by representatives from CAC member organisations. The session provided participants with practical tips and advice to protect themselves and their communities from cold weather-related health risks. Participants were introduced to preventive measures and essential practices to stay safe and healthy during winter.

                            The session covered key health concerns such as cold waves, respiratory illnesses, and smog, focusing on simple solutions like proper clothing, nutritious diets, and home care measures. Special attention was given to supporting vulnerable groups, including children, the elderly, and outdoor workers. The team also highlighted how community members can prepare for emergencies and ensure household readiness.

                            To enhance outreach, winter-specific IEC materials were shared, which members can use to raise awareness in their localities. The session concluded with a reminder that preparedness is key to staying safe during the colder months.
