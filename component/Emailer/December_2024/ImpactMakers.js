                                This recognition reflects the work being done by Swastiâ€™s Precision Action Towards Climate and Health (PATCH) platform, which connects health and climate through real-time data to address the needs of vulnerable populations.

                                By fostering collaboration and community-driven action, PATCH offers practical solutions to tackle the health impacts of climate change. The feature is a call to action for policymakers, organisations, and individuals to support integrated approaches to health and climate, using tools like PATCH to ensure no community is left behind.
